## Description
> This app tries to automate basic processes shared across libraries, like adding books to the library, and allowing users borrow and return books.

## Installation

### BorrowedBook Controller

I use `includes` to do an inner join on the users, books, and borrowed_books tables

I use `includes` to do an inner join on the users, books, and borrowed_books tables
